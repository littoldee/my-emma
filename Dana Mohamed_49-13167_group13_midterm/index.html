                        <p class="text-1">Salams beautiful,
                        EMMA is bringing a fresh and modern look to the modest fashion scene.  We saw a gap in the industry where modest minded women are not acknowledged nor catered for.  We decided to be part of the change!
                        EMMA stems phonetically from the word  ÿ£ŸéŸÖŸéÿ© , meaning servant of Allah Ô∑ª   It reflects our belief in how faith reflects the way we dress.  It also stands for Elegant, Modern, Modest Attire.  We believe dressing modestly and fashionably shouldn‚Äôt be mutually exclusive.
                        We‚Äôd love to share this journey with you,
                        
                        Let‚Äôs be modest and proud.</p>
                    </div>
                 </div>

                   <div>
                        <p class=text-t>Keeping your heart alive</p>
                        <p class="text-1">It‚Äôs easy to feel alone or forgotten in this world, with everything happening too fast or too intense, making you feel insignificant, unheard and lost in it all.  But the One who created you never forgets you, and He is always calling on to you‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre just not listening.


                            Look at life as a string of signs from God to you, from the slightest leaf moving across you, to the most -in your face- signs that shake your being. They‚Äôre all messages from Him,  calling you and drawing you nearer to Him. You are not alone. You are loved and there is a reason for your existence.</p>

                        <p class="text-1">My hijab story is nothing but a love story with my Creator. I get asked questions like: ‚Äúwhy are you wearing it, if you have nice hair?‚Äù or ‚Äúare you forced to wear it?‚Äù Or ‚Äúhow come you are wearing it while you have been living abroad all of your life?‚Äù

                            See all these questions are legitimate, because they don‚Äôt know the depth of why I wear it. I usually respond with, have you ever been in love with someone? You know, catching all the feels and the bees knees. Now if you know that something makes the person you love happy wouldn‚Äôt you do it? However the task may be, hard or easy, long or short, makes sense to you or not.</p>
